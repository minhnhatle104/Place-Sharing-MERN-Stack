# MERNStack

Documenting my process of learning to build a full MERNStack application following Maximilian Schwarzmüller's (Academind) tutorial on Udemy **React, NodeJS, Express & MongoDB - The MERN Fullstack Guide**

# Pros and Cons (based on my experience so far)
- Easy to weave in to any basic HTML projects. Its lightweight, doesn't have too much bloat. Use extensions only when needed. Easy to understand and refactor into current HTML as it is able to compartmentalize large chunks of HTML code in a page into smaller components.
- Props is an odd way of transferring data from one element to another. I wonder if there's another app-wide way to do it...
- Unfamiliar with the syntax but not different enough that I can't figure out where I should put curly brackets and where I should use JSX. Due to how lightweight the app feels on hot reload, I could just learn by trial-and-error to get familiar with the syntax.
- Seems like I really need to pick up Max Schwartz's separate Udemy course on React after this because the whole Hooks concept is much much more than what it seems to an amateur experimenter like me. I find it really difficult to understand and I couldn't follow in sections where Hooks are being used (which, frankly, is most of it where state is concerned).
